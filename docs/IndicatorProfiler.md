# Indicator Profiler

 - [take me there now](extension:IndicatorProfiler)

The **Indicator Profiler Extension** tests all of the installed [Indicators](Indicators) to 
see how much of an **edge** (**alpha**) they provide. It does this by comparing the **average 
return** when the [Indicator](Indicators) enters various **signal states** to the overall 
**average return** of the market.

The **Indicator Profiler** performs two different types of analysis:

 - [Indicator Profile Results](AnalyzeAllIndicators)
 - [Indicator Evaluator](IndicatorEvaluator)
