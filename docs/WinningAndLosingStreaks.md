# Streaks

## Winning Streaks

This money management method is based on a system’s historical record of maximum consecutive winning and losing trades. Not only a high extended streak of winning trades is pleasing from the psychological standpoint, but also suggests a system has a good fit with some specific market conditions.

With this PositionSizer, you're prepared to find the answer to whether a system’s pattern of consecutive winners can be used to help forecast the outcome of the next trade. Each consecutive winning trade increases the position size, determined by one of the three Wealth-Lab's standard choices, by a specified percentage (Increase %). To prevent from building too large a position, you can choose to stop increasing the size after a predefined streak. Finally, increasing will stop after the first losing trade.

## Losing Streaks

This money management method is the exact opposite of Winning Streaks, and increases trade size after successive losing trades. It's also called the "Martingale" method i.e. double trade size on loss. The difference to Martingale is that you have fine control over the size. The logic is that every losing streak eventually ends, so the odds the next trade will be a winner are always increasing during such a streak.

Each consecutive losing trade increases the position size, determined by one of the three Wealth-Lab's standard choices, by a specified percentage amount (Increase %). To prevent from creating a potentially harmful position, you can stop increasing the size after a predefined losing streak. Finally, increasing the size will stop after the first winning trade.
