# Welcome to Wealth-Lab 8!
The purpose of this product is to allow you to test your trading ideas before risking 
money trading them. Using a process called **backtesting** you'll develop trading 
[Strategies](Strategies) and test them on historical market data. 

You'll use the following four step process:

## 1. Development
You'll express your trading strategy ideas by creating [Strategies](Strategies). 
You can use the drag and drop **Building Blocks** to develop a Strategy visually, 
or if you're a C# programmer, use the code editor to write Strategy code by hand.

## 2. Backtesting
Select a data **DataSet** and backtest your Strategy to see how well it performed over 
time. Wealth-Lab offers many unique views into your Strategy's performance results.

## 3. Forward Testing
Forward testing involves running your model on a daily basis after the backtesting 
phase has been completed.  This practice can expose certain flaws in a model, such 
as over-optimization and survivorship bias.

## 4. Trading
Once you are confident in your model, it is time to bank real money on it and begin 
trading it live. Wealth-Lab interfaces with a number of brokers, so you can place 
trading signals directly and automatically.
