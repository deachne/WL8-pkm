# Contribution

This performance visualizer shows a breakdown of total profit or loss in multi-symbol backtests:

* On a per instrument basis (default)
* By entry signal name
* By exit signal name
* By calendar month
* By average % P/L per bar
* By position type (long/short)
* By Strategy name (in MetaStrategies)

To switch views, choose from the "Group by" dropdown box. The chart's title will display "profit"/"loss" depending on portfolio outcome.

**Notes**

To benefit from grouping by *entry/exit name*, your Strategy must assign meaningful entry and/or exit signals.
