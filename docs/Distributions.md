## Distributions

The distribution histograms provide a good overall illustration of your system's dynamics. The graph illustrates the distribution by a certain metric based on all the trades generated by the strategy. Metrics include: Profit %, Profit, Bars Held, % Profit Per Bar.

The results are divided into a number of evenly-distributed bins. In the case of Profit %, each bar on the graph contains a number of trades whose profit falls within the upper bounds of the bin.  For example, imagine that the bins are spaced apart by 5% each.  The bin labeled 10% contains 20 trades.  This means that 20 trades had a net profit between 5 and 10%.
