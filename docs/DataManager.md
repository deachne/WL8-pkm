# Data Manager

 - [take me there now](action:DataManager)
 - see also [Data Preferences](DataPreferences)

The **Data Manager** is the place to go for: 

 - **[DataSets](DataSetsTab)**: define, modify, and update your test data
 - **[Historical Providers](HistoricalProvidersTab)**:  set up and test connections
 -  **[Event Providers](EventProvidersTab)**:  configure non-price data items
 - **[Streaming Provider](StreamingProviders)**: select and configure your default  
 - **Schedule Updates**: schedule auto updates for selected historical providers


## Event Providers
This group of providers includes fundamental, news, and pattern providers.  Just as for Historical Providers, check the providers here that you want use for backtesting and charting.  To optimize speed, check only the providers you care to use.

## Update Log/Scheduled Update
Set the local time for the a scheduled update to run and select the Historical and/or Event Providers options.  

Data for symbols and scales that you've requested in the past (i.e., cached) for the "checked" Historical and Event providers will be updated for all scales. 

< %{color:blue}**Important!**%   For an auto update to occur, you must leave the Data Manager open to this [**Scheduled Update**](ScheduledUpdateTab) tab view.
Alternatively, use the Windows Task Scheduler to launch Wealth-Lab to update following the [Task Scheduler Update procedure](ScheduledUpdateTab). >
