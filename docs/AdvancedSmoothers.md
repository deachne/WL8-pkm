# Advanced Smoothers

**Advanced Smoothers** is an indicator library consisting of 13 cutting edge 
**smoothers**. A smoother is an indicator that can be applied to source data to 
produce a smoothed version. These indicators go beyond the traditional Simple 
Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and the other standard smoothers. They deliver outstanding smoothing as well as low lag. The indicator library includes:

- ALMA (Armand Legoux Moving Average)
- Butterworth (2 and 3 pole Butterworth filters)
- DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average)
- GD (Generalized DEMA)
- HMA (Hull Moving Average)
- InstantaneousTrendLine2 (by John Ehlers)
- Kalman (Kalman Filter)
- KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average)
- T3 (Tim Tilson''s T3 indicator)
- TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average)
- VIDYA (Volatility Index Dynamic Average)
- VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average)
- WLMA (Wealth-Lab Moving Average based on Adaptive Lookback)'
