# Assembly References

 - [take me there now](action:AssemblyReferences)

When working with [C# Coded Strategies](CSharpCodeBased), Wealth-Lab automatically adds **references** to all of the .NET assemblies your **Strategy** should need. If there seems to be a **reference** missing, you can use this tool to add it.
## .NET Assemblies
All of the available .NET framework assemblies are listed here. Check the box(es) for the assemblies you want to reference.
## Custom Assemblies
Custom assemblies must first be copied into the Wealth-Lab installation folder in order to be referenced. After you've copied an assembly DLL over, restart Wealth-Lab. The custom assembly should be automatically referenced and available for use in your C#-Coded Strategies.
