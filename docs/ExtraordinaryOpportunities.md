# Extraordinary opportunities

This money management technique can be found in Tushar S. Chande's book "Beyond Technical Analysis". The idea is to increase trade size to capture outsized profits when there are occasional prolonged trends or violent market moves.

According to Chande, a bullish "extraordinary opportunity" is identified when the shoter-period SMA of closing prices crosses over the upper band, constructed by adding some percentage to the longer-period SMA of closing prices. The opposite defines a bearish "extraordinary opportunity".

The SMA periods, as well as % Deviation from the longer-term SMA, are configurable. Last but not least, "Increase trade size" determines the percentage change to the basis size.
