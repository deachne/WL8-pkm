The Log Viewer contains selected informational, warning, or error messages that have occurred during the current Wealth-Lab session - especially for broker and data provider connections.  The contents and history of the messages may help to understand an event (e.g., why data wasn't returned from a Provider) and could assist the Wealth-Lab team to troubleshoots bugs.
