## Drawdown Curve

The Drawdown Curve visualizer presents two different ways of analyzing equity Drawdown. 

### Strategy Drawdown Curve (Underwater Equity Curve)

The Underwater Equity Curve displays equity Drawdown on a walk-forward basis.  This means that the percentage of drawdown is with respect to maximum equity achieved up to that point in time.  As in the Profit Distribution view, you have the choice of displaying your data in percentage (default) or dollar representations using the right click menu. 

The depth of the current Drawdown is displayed on a bar by bar basis, covering the complete period of the historical simulation.  You can quickly identify the periods of deepest and longest Drawdown.


For backtest periods involving a large number of bars, it may not be possible to display the exact drawdown for each bar due to screen rendering errors.  For exact value of Max Drawdown, refer to the tabular data in the Performance report. 

### Number of Bars since Last Equity High

This graph displays the number of bars since a new equity high was achieved.  This can give you an idea of how long you may  have to wait to recover from drawdowns in your account when trading the strategy.
